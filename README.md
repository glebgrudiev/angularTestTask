# Getting Started

To setup the project, run:
```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

To start developing, run:

```sh
$ gulp serve
```

This will fire up a local web server, open http://localhost:9000 in your default browser and watch files for changes, reloading the browser automatically via [LiveReload].
